# Run oCIS on bare metal

oCIS runs on bare metal in a single binary. It works on Linux and mac.

## How do you get the ocis binary

- Find and download the latest version suitable for your OS (NO, :-) windows is not supported yet!)

## What does it take to run it locally

- Find the start command

### Problems

- Did you run into OS specific problems?
- What are the system requirements needed to run ocis?

## Can you run it on port 443

- Lessons from the last session help
- The config keys are the same like for the docker container

## Check if it runs

- Sanity checks of the different services
- Are the demo users available?
- Can ocis write to the storage?

## How does it run in one process

- I thought oCIS consists of microservices? Why do I only see one process?
- How do I run it in different processes?
